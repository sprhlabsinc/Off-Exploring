/**
	@brief A UIViewController Subclass that displays the home screen for the app. Links to the various pages through the app
 
	This class is the home screen of the app that users see when they first load up the app, after registration / login. Once 
	they are logged in, it is there default view. It provides links to the various jump in points on the app (view blogs, view
	albums / photos, edit settings, view hostels etc). It also regonises and handles login operations if the user changes there login details.
	It downloads a users itinerary for use as part of hostel suggestions and so sets itself as an OffexploringConnection Delegate.
	It handles what to do if there is no internet when the user loads the app, setting the blog section into editing only mode
	and disallowing access to the photo section.
